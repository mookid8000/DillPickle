Feature: DillPickle should work
  As a software developer
  In order to code good
  I want object mappers and type converters to just work
  
  Scenario: Simple type conversion
	Given something like this:
		| Name		| Age		|
		| Niels		| 11 months	|
		| Hugo		| 4 years	|
	When I say "go to bed"
	Then they go to bed - no questions asked :)
